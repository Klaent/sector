# Genetic Expansion

The **Genetic Expansion** took place in 2425 and is used to refer to a controversial era where humans creaated multiple [intelligence species](../page_index.md#species) in distorted [genetic modding experiments](../technology/genetic_modification) and unfortunately did not know what to do with them.

The **Genetic Expansion** is one of the leading causes of the [Human Union](human_union_split) and the [Federation Civil War](wars/federation_civil_war).
