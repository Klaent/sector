<h1>Network Of Knowledge | Main Page</h1>

<i>"Hello, I am your XPert, the NOK librarian. Though, you can call me PER, standing for Perceptional Exceptional Responder. If you have any questions, you can search in my query console. Keep quiet in the NOK, please. My nodes don't like it when the sound sensors get overloaded."</i>

The Network of Knowledge is a library of information gathered through multiple sources such as anonymous submissions, interviews of countless people from countless sides, the secrecy of the NOK and years of piecing together information by an underpaid AI. If you are reading this, you are most likely one of the few people in the Quadrant (or beyond!) to gather almost **all information on seperate sides**, this includes (but are not limited to) intelligence agencies, massacres, cults, classified documents, and more.

<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>

- Each Quadrant (galaxy) has a unique trait about it, the Milky Way's being [Ampersand Space](technology/ampersand_space).
- Each faction is wrong in their own way, but it's up to the reader to believe which faction is morally good or bad.
- Culture is diverse on the Quadrant, one sector could be techtianity believers while the next could be athiests.
- Anything can happen on the Quadrant as long as it follows the laws of physics.
