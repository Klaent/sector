> **OOC**: The Network of Knowledge is heavily roleplay-focused, think of it as a book. Any out of context notes will be prefixed with a bold "OOC", to let you know that this isn't part of the story.

<i>"Hello, I am your XPert, the NOK librarian. Though, you can call me PER, standing for Perceptional Exceptional Responder. If you have any questions, you can search in my query console. Keep quiet in the NOK, please. My nodes don't like it when the sound sensors get overloaded."</i>

The **Network of Knowledge** or **Project: Babel** is a library of information gathered through multiple sources such as anonymous submissions, interviews of countless people from countless sides, leaked documents and a virus that has secretly been in every system that every faction that has ever lived, finally the secrecy of the NOK and years of piecing together information by an underpaid AI.

If you are reading this, you are most likely one of the few people in the Quadrant (or even further) to gather almost **all information on seperate sides**, this includes (but are not limited to) intelligence agencies, massacres, cults, classified documents, and more.

The Quadrant is still growing, as the underpaid AIs continue to uncover the mysteries and further of the Quadrant. There's culture to be found and made, and there's technology to be documented.
