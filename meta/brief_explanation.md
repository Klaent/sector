In Sol years, the year is 4853, humans are around the same as humans in the 21st century, speaking Quadrantical Common.

The Milky Way galaxy is commonly known as **The Quadrant** (or the 33th Quadrant). The quadrant is currently trying to figure out how to keep itself from eradicating itself, the Federation continues to form peace and fail at it, while it also deals with a civil war.

**The Quadrant** consists of multiple **sectors** which borders are somewhat agreed upon.

The technological combination of multiple and species, inactive and active, skirmishes and battles forcing rapid technological growth in order to fight the enemy and win have lead to the year 4853.

The Sol System is declared uninhabitable by the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) after the Earth was deemed uninhabitable due to the [sol wars](events/wars/sol_wars).

## Summarization Of Events

In 2098, humans finally got off the rock known as Earth and began orbital stations around it. There were numerous arguments about this by the UN but ultimately, a main planetary orbital station was planned alongside civilian housing facilities. Meanwhile, numerous companies began commercial and industrial spaceflights.

The progress between 2098-2124 was slow due to the politics of Earth slowing it down, however in 2132 one of the officers onboard a major communication network ordered the shutdown of Earth-Space communication satelites, specifically the command satelites. For 3 days, commanders from Earth were unable to communicate to those in space. On the 4th day, the officer held the networks hostage, and told the commanders to formally to stop earth politics from affecting space development. <!-- ironic -->

This appeared to be one of the earliest forms of the Federation's existence, as just 21 years later, in 2153 the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) was formed at a rally on an orbital station.

The Federation's mission at the time was simple, make sure politics on Earth stop affecting politics in space. Satelites from Earth to space were shut down, with Earth sending marines to the stations to shut it down. This started the 2 week long [Federation revolution](/articles/events/federation_revolution.md)

Due to all the charge weaponry that the marines used were using technology that the Federation created, the Federation quickly stopped supplying Earth with weapons, and the workers won against the marines and won their independence.

Following the creation of the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation), multiple divisions of the Federation were created, such as the [Tauri Division](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) managing most research, innovation and manufacturing.

Around the time of 2205, the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) began to suspect traitorous activities amongst the [Tauri Division](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) workers, and told Tauri mercenaries to take out the main orbital station and wipe the databanks. Around three days later after the order was sent, the [Tauri Division](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) threatened to use a planetkiller on the main Federation base sat on one of Saturn's moons Titan, before seceding 2 weeks later.

The [Tauri Division](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) (now the Tauri Corporation) was kind enough to license [Ampersand Drives](technology/ampersand_drives) to the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) before seceding.

With the Federation's leading research department seceding, the Federation had to make due with the ships they currently had and created four main divisions: The **Administration**, **Engineering**, **Research** and **Defense** divisions.

In 2425, the [**Genetic Expansion**](events/genetic_expansion) occurred during a [genetic modification experiment](technology/genetic_modification), people were not sure what to do with said alien species. Some people suggested keeping them for research, others suggested incorporating them under the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation).

It took around 4 years for the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) to come to a consensus, and within those 4 years; rumors of a major civil war occuring were widespread as a certain [Human Union](/articles/faction/organization/human_union) were planning to secede. The [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) decided to embrace their alien brothers & sisters (and all other wacky genders they have) and welcome them all a seat on the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) council.

Despite their previous hardships, the [Tauri Corporation](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) offered an alliance and contract with the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation), in which they accepted.

The [Human Union](/articles/faction/organization/human_union) immediately began to secede after hearing of this news, in an incident known as the [Human Union Secede](events/human_union_secede).

With the [Human Union](/articles/faction/organization/human_union) seceded, it stole technology from the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) as well. The [Human Union](/articles/faction/organization/human_union) now had a fleet, and alongside that had contracts with the [Tauri Corporation](/articles/factions/companies/tauri).

Today, the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) fights a civil war with the [Human Union](/articles/faction/organization/human_union) while the [Tauri Corporation](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) rolls in money.

## Species

Humans are the base for all types of species.

There have been no records of alien life, and there probably never will be. Despite that, humans have attempted to make alien species themselves known simply as "Species".

Most species created were by the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) or [Tauri Division](/articles/factions/companies/tauri) on accident with genetic modification.
