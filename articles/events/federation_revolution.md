On the day of 8/23/2153, the Federation Revolution officially began.

TL;DR for you reader: Earth sent Marines to take out the workers of the Federation, however due to all their weaponry being manufactured in space + the fact that the marines didn't know how to operate their weapons, the Federation won and became Independent of Earth.
