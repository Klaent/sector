The **Earth FTL Incident** is an incident in which a cargo transport ship in FTL drifted off course, crashing straight into Earth.

A cargo freighter by the name of **Monsoon** was transporting around 300 ounces of liquid antimatter, the **Monsoon** was part of a faction so minor that it doesn't even show up in the factions NoK.

## Pre-FTL

The crew of six aboard the **Monsoon** tightened the locks on the Antimatter sealing it tight, before initiating a systems check. Prior to this, the navigational systems were broken due to a pirate raid, and was cheap. However, the **Monsoon** flew fine despite the damaged nav system, and so the crew skipped this over.

## FTL

The **Monsoon** launched into FTL from Sector O to Sector U, crossing Sector S with an estimated time of around **18.2 days**. The crew had all food ready, and had recreational activities alongside it.

On 7/21/3253, around **6.4 days** into transit, the **Monsoon**'s navigation systems failed while the crew was asleep. The ship's maintenance systems alarmed the crew however the night prior, the crew decided to drink alcohol. This resulted in the passing out of the six crewmembers above the **Monsoon**.

The ship was flying blind, and because of this, the **Monsoon** hit a rogue asteroid scraping off a good chunk of it's front hull, throwing the ship off course and waking up the crew. By the time this had happened, it was too late. 184 ounces of -H had been leaked throwing the ship *way* off course, heading towards Earth in **43.6 seconds**.

## Crash

The **Monsoon** crashed directly onto `48.85684153112575, 2.348480899175175` or the remains of Paris, France. The ship cut straight through the planet, cutting straight through the core and causing the surrounding areas of Europe up to the United Kingdom to spontaneously explode, completely ripping the Earth into pieces, leaving nothing left.
