The **Human Union** is a group of human supremacists who believe that alien species in the [genetic expansion](/articles/events/genetic_expansion) should be either erradicated or put aside.

## History

Originally rumored to occur as a joke when the [Federation](/articles/factions/governments/federation) began to figure out what to do with these alien species, the main reason why this occurred was due to many workers believing that their jobs will be replaced by an alien; as many [Federation](../governments/federation) workers worked hazardous jobs, and these alien species were much more agile, allowing for less accidents.

After a century of the Human Union's existence, they invented [Human English](/articles/culture/languages/human_english) allowing for more encrypted communications.

Not long after that, the Human Union realized that their genetic differentiated buddies were exploited, and decided to stop their original goal of "purging the Federation and aliens" and rather switch to "purging the Federation" only.
