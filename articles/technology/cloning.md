**Cloning** is a technology created by the [Tauri Corporation](../factions/tauri) and the [Federation](../factions/federation) while working together.

There are 4 major types of cloning, which most (if not all) violate being-rights.

## Growth Cloning

**Growth Cloning** is essentially cloning a body except as a fetus in a [growth tube](/articles/technology/growth_tube), with the same mind, but loss of memory and skills. A complete restart at life.

## Printing Cloning

**Printing Cloning** or **Print-Cloning** is a faster way to clone dead individuals, practically bringing them back from the dead. However, in order to print-clone, you require flesh and organs (optionally, replacements), and stuffing the consciousness into an AI core, before 3D printing a brand new body with new organs, then moving said consciousness into the new body.

Print-Cloning is **highly dangerous** due to the amount of things that can go wrong, such as genetic deformities, or sometimes just flat out causing an abomination in agony.

## Ampersand Cloning

**Ampersand Cloning** is exactly like [Growth Cloning](#growth-cloning) except you put the fetus in Ampersand for 1 minute, before taking it out.

**Ampersand Cloning** is banned in many factions, as it's extremely inhumane and traumatizing for the person being cloned, not to mention the loss of all skills and memories.

## Advanced Cloning

**Advanced Cloning** is a method initially created by the [BEOWULF](../factions/minor/beowulf) and further developed by the [Tauri Corporation](../factions/tauri) which allows cloning with only a strand of DNA. **Advanced Cloning** is extremely unstable and may cause a defect in the clone, swiss cheesed organs, and sometimes just not spitting out nothing but blood lacking DNA.
