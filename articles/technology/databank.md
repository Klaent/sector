Databanks are massive binary storage devices designed to store almost 1 yottabyte in just a small structure. Databanks on ships are usually built into an [AI Core](ai_cores) while the [Federation Great Network Of Knowledge](network_of_knowledge) usually consists of major databanks the size of entire libraries, holding around 500x more information than the average library.

A 'perma-lock' allows full writing privileges to the disk until a physical switch is pulled preventing any writing.
