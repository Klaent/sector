Cryosleep is one of the main methods to preserve intelligent lifeforms for an indefinite amount of time. Most cryosleep techniques involve transfering the brain (or the sentience) into an [AI Core](ai_cores) for long-term preservation, while the body is held in an indefinite stasis - preventing them from aging, moving and more. Most [sleeper pods](#sleeper-pods) are built in with a single AI core and life support systems. While in cryosleep, the [sleeper](#sleeper) aren't really *asleep* per se but rather in a state of stasis and the mind is left to it's own imagination. Cryosleep is also used as a recreational activity.

## Sleeper Pods

Sleeper Pods (also known as Sleeper Banks for mass groups) are machines sized to fit the average humanoid inside, usually built with a small [databank](databank), an [AI Core](ai_cores) and life support systems to sustain indefinite cryosleep.

## Sleeper

A term to refer those who take part in cryosleep.
