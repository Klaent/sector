**Charge Shielding** creates a one-way shield using [charge energy](/articles/technology/charge_energy.md) allowing for the reflecting of kinetic energy or the redirection of heat energy into heatsinks. The more powerful the charge shield is, the bigger it reaches.

**Charge Shields** are extremely compact, allowing them to be turned into an armor, reflecting the charges and bullets of incoming projectiles.
