Slimes are jello-like creatures with a 'rigid' outer shell, keeping them intact.

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|No bones|Vulnerable to cuts and holes|
|Flexible|Susceptible to slimeloss|
|Tolerance to punches|Weak punches|
|Speak Bubblish|Squishy|

## Appearance

Slimes skin color depends on the color of their slime, which is affected by genetics.

They are slightly transculent allowing objects from behind to be seen, due to their rigid shell.

Their rigid shell is flexible, allowing them to tolerate more bruises, at the cost of weak punches themselves

## Anatomy

Slimes have a rigid outer shell holding their main internal organs in, this is commonly known as the "Shell" or the "Ectoplasm". This shell has an oobleck-like structure, being very flexible and containing a human-like structure while also being able to be hard as human skin. This rigid shell is very transculent, making it seem as if there is a clear outline over the slime. This rigid shell allows the slime to not spread sticky and wet slime all over whatever they touch.

The slime's organs are the gas sacs, the slime core, and the slime itself, alongside some organs taken from humans (eyes, mouth, etc).

The slime is the slime's blood, it is in a jello-like format in the first layer however begins to show a more sticky and liquid-like form in the second and last layer. This slime is in all over the slimes body, submerging most of the internal organs, and allowing more fluid roads for oxygen and nutrients to be distributed. This slime also possesses the ability to move, as shown in the below.

The slime core acts as the "all-in-one" organ, acting as the brain, heart, kidneys, and more. This core communicates through the slime, allowing for movement and more.

The gas sacs are the slime's lungs, breathing with oxygen.

The slime lifecycle begins when a parental slime splits in half in a differed version of mitosis, where the parental slime survives and rather an amoeba-like egg spews out, in which they begin to evolve into a child at around the age of 3 when they develop legs and arms, and then at the age of 6 they begin to show human-like features, before growing into a human-like adult at the age of 16.

## Origin

Originally created when sudden radiation flipped a few bits on a gene modification machine while trying to create a superweapon, accidentally creating the squishy race we know today.
