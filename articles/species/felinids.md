The merging of a cat and a human due to a genetic disruption during a cloning process lead to the creation of the **Feline**.

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Really agile|Less focus|
|Negates fall damage|Solitary|
|Extremely manipulative|Nobody trusts them|

## Appearance

As a replacement for human ears, they have cat ears allowing them to hear further. These ears are 4 inches in length, 3 inches in diameter, being 1/4th of an inch flat and the curvature of their ears depends on genetics.

They have a cat-like tail purturingfuihr out of the tail bone at the bottom of the spine.

## Anatomy

There are no major differences that have not been listed that differ from the base human race aside from a much more thin body, requiring less nutrition with more agility, at the cost of bad focus such as the attraction to lasers, including **charge weaponry** and yarn.

The feline life cycle begins when a pregnant mother gives birth creating a kitten, at the age of 6 they begin their childhood understanding themselves and a prime learning opportunity in their childhood. At the age of 15 they become an adult, having full access to exploit and manipulate their body to their will.

## Origin

Originally came to life when a bug in the genetic modding system caused an irreversible process where people received unwanted genes, thus creating the feline.
