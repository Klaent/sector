# AI Cores

![ai core](../images/thumbnail/ai_core.png)

**AI Cores** (standing for Artificial Intelligence) are advanced computers capable of holding a sentient being or creating a sentient being for a special edge-case. These special edge cases range from maintaining a ships course during long trips or preserving sentient minds.

**AI Cores** were first developed by the [Tauri Division](../factions/tauri) in the early founding of the [Federation](../factions/federation). **AI Cores** at the time were able to hold a human brain's consciousness indefinetely.

**Sentient Artificial Consciousness** were developed by the [Tauri Corporation](../factions/tauri) a few years after seceding from the [Federation](../factions/federation), allowing a user to create a completely unique consciousness to their desire.
