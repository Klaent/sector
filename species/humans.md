# Humans (Human)

All species are subsets of human, they are boring and uninteresting; not to mention they are everywhere, being the most common species by far.

## Appearance

Humans look like humans, what else is there?

## Anatomy

Humans have human organs, what else is there?

## Origin

Human life originated in the Sol system, specifically on Earth, evolving from the apes.

## Post Genetic Expansion

Humans mainly divided into either the [Union](../factions/organization/human_union.md) or the [Federation](../factions/governments/federation.md) - as the Genetic Expansion caused mass drama in the entire Quadrant, being the main cause for the war.
