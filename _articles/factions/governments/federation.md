> "For the quadrant and beyond!"

The **Federation** is one of the eldest surviving factions, and a general Federation of most
species, trying for equality.

## History

Initially founded in 2153 after the researchers, mercenaries and engineers got tired of land
politics affected life in space, with the first Federation rally happening in the same year.

It began to grow rapidly, the Federation ran as humans wanting to ditch the old Earth ways of arguing over land politics. It developed divisions such as the [Tauri Division (now the Tauri Corporation)](../companies/tauri).

There began a distrust between the Tauri Division and the Federation as weapons of mass destruction and [planetkillers](../technology/planetkillers) (DO NOT RESEARCH) were developed, and [antimatter](../technology/antimatter) was discovered.

After the discovery of [antimatter](../technology/antimatter), the Federation ordered the massacre of all Tauri Division workers by Tauri Division mercenaries. The Tauri Mercenaries decided to warn the researchers, engineers and workers.

Tauri developed a planetkiller and threatened to use it on the main Federation base, before seceding from the Federation.

## Controversy

The **Federation** has been square-one in many controversies across the Quadrant, such as the time where the **Tauri Division** seceded from the **Federation** and people began to question the competence of the **Federation**.
