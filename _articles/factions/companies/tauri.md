> "War with others creates opportunities for commissions and contracts, why stop on one side when you can be on both sides?" - Anita Tauri, CEO

One of the few surviving Earth-era companies, developing robotic technology and researching rapidly.

The [Tauri Corporation](tauri) is a lead in the science, technology, and combat industries. It is the quadrant's largest company, with contracts to both sides of the galactic civil war.

## History

Initially founded in 2155 under the [Federation](../governments/federation) under the codename 'Tauri Division', consisting of the quadrant's best researchers, mercenaries, engineers and more to develop the best ships to explore, fight and put down resistance.

The [Tauri Corporation](tauri) is to blame for most technology and weapons used today. [Ampersand space and drives](../technology/ampersand_drives) and [antimatter](../technology/antimatter) were all due to Tauri..

During the Tauri Divison era when the Tauri Corporation was under [Federation](../governments/federation) control, they developed [planetkillers](../technology/planetkillers) and discovered [antimatter](../technology/antimatter). The Federation believed that Tauri could not be controlled, in which they were right.

The Federation sent **Tauri Mercenaries** to steal the Tauri research and kill all the workers, Tauri Mercenaries agreed to this but didn't preform the massacre; rather informing the researchers about the situation. The researchers handed a prototype antimatter planetkiller and the mercenaries threatened to use the planetkiller on the Federation's main station of operations, before seceding off into the today's **Tauri Corporation**.

## Controversy

**Tauri Corporation** has been a major lead in many controversies, such as the allowing of **antimatter bombing** which is considering inhumane by the [Federation](../governments/federation) and defending the usage of planetkillers.

A major controversy involving the **Tauri Corporation** is that they profit off of the civil war. Due to having contracts with both the [Federation](../governments/federation) and the [Human Union](../organization/human_union.md), if either side loses, the **Tauri Corporation** profits and wins.

## Rumors

- The **Tauri Corporation** CEO may have been killed off by an AI and all orders by the 'CEO' have been an AI.
- The **Tauri Corporation** sparked the **Federation-Union** civil war to profit off both their fighting.

## Diplomatic Chart

- **Allies:** [Human Union](../organization/human_union.md), [Galactic Federation](../governments/federation.md), The Heir
- **Enemies:** [Botani Union](../organization/botani.md), [BEOWULF](beowulf), [Pirates](../organization/pirates.md)
