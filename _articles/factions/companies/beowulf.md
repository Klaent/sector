Developing on research, study, discovery, technology, biology, development, renovation and recreation.
These are who will make a new safe earth, where humanity will be back again in past days where technology wasn't everything and where pollution didn't often spread around the place. And also find new planets, to discover. To learn. To better.

It is independant and one of the first few leads of recreation and science, similar to [Tauri](../governments/tauri) but they do not profit off of combat and war, they profit off of civilian jobs and peace, welfare and fairness. They are the first intelligence unit which researchers work on investigatory research. Holding prized information that the Quadrant does not even know.

## History

Intitially founded in 4851, around December 12. The day a ship was detected exiting [Deadzone](../../sectors/controlled/aj) space. This attracted the media, and caused a new research opportunity for multiple companies after proving the Deadzone was in fact able to be traversed, and giving some hope for those trapped inside.

The [IIBE(UO)R (IBER) (Independent Intelligence Bureau of Ethnic Unorthodox Research)](beowulf) or the [Beowulf Central Coop (BC)](beowulf) is an independent multibillionaire faction that specializes on research and unorthodox discovery work, scout expeditions and have stations in Deadzone all over and out, noted the founder has been able to enter the [Deadzone](../../sectors/controlled/aj) and out using a new space drive during the historical events of their journey, establishing a new faction of a new horizon that helped flock researchers for their skill and integrity, similar to [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), except they explore near the depths of the near-observable universe to collect more information for the world and their unsolved required information to expand, they conquer most of Sector AJ.

They are led by The **Head of Administration** by rank and composed of 6 Divisions in total, excluding the Head of Administration. Coming from varied forms of names and color of form. To expand on the world and astronomy once again, to discover, to research and to increase defenses for all of mankind, they are mostly passive & friendly, or neutral. Excluding to [Pirates](../organization/pirates).

They are open trade to most others, including civilians, as that is what they do. To improve on technology and current equipment. Beowulf currently is a minor faction, they profit engineers and researchers to their work alike. They also profit farmers, selling seeds and often help regrowing a new earth.

They are the original manufacturers and developers of the **ACM®** (Rightfully owned by [Tauri](../companies/tauri)) and the **Holotouch®** supervised by AI, arm-augmentation tech. Physical holographic touch. And many more contributions.

## Events

- Beowulf Cargo was approaching Tauri territory to offer Tauri the ACM® after it's manufacturing
- Tauri proceeded to raid Beowulf Cargo and thankfully injured a few subjects, stealing the ACM® successfully
- Beowulf in retaliation raided Tauri territory using an Ampersand drive and injured only a few subjects with a hardbox which contained Expensive Alcohol and a sign that said "The ACM® was supposedly offered to you anyway." with a small defusable timed antimatter bomb on a special compartment

## Rumors

- The [Blackbox](../../sectors/controlled/aj) recording which were inherently stolen by Tauri from Lucens Spei (the founder of Beowulf) which were classified Quadrant audio was leaked and Beowulf was blamed for it. It was not confirmed true yet but Beowulf simply claims that the rumors were false, that amused the public and simply stopped talking about it, except for some.
- Beowulf stole Tauri corp property, which is true by Tauri terms but false by public terms.
