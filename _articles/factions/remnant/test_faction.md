# Test Faction

Rumored to not even exist by [Federation](../federation) officials, the **Test Faction** was the 'first' faction in the Federation databank as a developer was creating it, developers today still can't remove the **Test Faction** and have become a little inside joke in the [Federation](../federation) Databank.

The **Test Faction** roams the [Federation](../federation) databank as a remnant faction, as developers of the databank don't want to create a whole category dedicated to said faction.
