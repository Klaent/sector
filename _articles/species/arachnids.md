# Arachnids (Arachnid)

A human with their bottom half replaced with one of a spider.

## Appearance

Arachnids appear to have the bottom half of their bodies replaced with the body of a spider, with the ability to create webs and has 8 legs - not to mention they are able to climb surfaces easily.

## Anatomy

The arachnid's lower body seems to have the same organs as a regular tarantula, except sized to fit a human.

## Origin

Originated in a Tauri Division laboratory, as 25 test subjects were mutated alongside a tarantula sample and created the arachnid species.

## Post Genetic Expansion

Arachnids got a lot of hate by the Union, and joined the Federation.
