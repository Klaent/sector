# Distress (unknown author)

An incident occured on my ship while in Ampersand, I don't remember much after the explosions. I was just transporting some cargo before it sounded like hail was hitting the hull. The Captain elevated the ship to Red alert and we were told to man our stations, we were a cargo freighter and didn't have any weapons on us, though the Captain persisted we try to get out of here; but not before the pirates shot down our Ampersand drive. The Captain yelled at the engineers to 'fix the damn thing' but to no avail, as the ship ripped in half and I was thrown into an airlock.

I awoke to the sounds of power crackling and the emergency power on 10%.
